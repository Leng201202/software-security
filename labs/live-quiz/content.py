content.py — serve the course's own markdown (worksheets, lab READMEs) as HTML.

This is the content plane: SP-3 in instructor/FULL-PLATFORM-DESIGN.md, and the
half of "no Google" that replaces Classroom's *distribute the material* role.
Read-only, no student data, no upload.

WHY THIS DOESN'T USE A MARKDOWN LIBRARY
    Because of what is actually in these files. `labs/week05-xss-client-side/
    worksheet.md` line 56 instructs students to POST:

        <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

    and line 61 gives them a beacon that exfiltrates the cookie to a remote URL.
    Those are course content — the exercise — and they must render as *visible
    text a student can read and copy*, never as markup the browser executes.

    Every mainstream markdown renderer passes raw HTML through by default.
    Pointing one at this repo and serving the result from the same origin as the
    teacher's authenticated session would be stored XSS, delivered by our own
    teaching material, into the account that holds every student's grade. The
    Week 5 lab would have worked on the platform that teaches it.

    So: **escape the whole document first, then apply a small whitelist of
    markdown constructs to the already-escaped text.** Nothing can pass through,
    because by the time any construct is recognised there is no live markup left
    to recognise. That ordering is the entire security argument, and
    `test_content.py` holds it in place with the real Week 5 payloads.

    The cost is a deliberately limited dialect: headings, bold/italic/code,
    fenced code, lists, tables, links, blockquotes, rules. That covers what the
    worksheets use. It does not do footnotes, definition lists or inline HTML,
    and it should not grow to.

PATH SAFETY
    Content is addressed by a slug matched against a strict pattern and resolved
    against a fixed root, then verified to still be inside it after resolution —
    a slug never becomes a path fragment that `..` can walk out of.

# and would raise on `lesson07b`.

# WHY A DEDICATED img/ DIRECTORY, AND AN ALLOWLIST OF TYPES
#   A unit directory holds the lab's source, its compose files, its solutions.
#   If any file in it could be addressed as an image, this route would become a
#   way to read `solution_app.py` — the content plane already refuses to serve
#   that as a document, and it must not hand it back through another door. So an
#   image resolves ONLY at `<unit>/img/<name>`, and only with a known extension.
#
# WHY SVG IS ALLOWED ANYWAY
#   An SVG can contain <script>. Loaded through <img> a browser will not run it
#   — that is a hard rule of the img element, not a heuristic. Loaded by
#   NAVIGATING to the file it will. The renderer only ever emits <img>, but the
#   URL is guessable, so the route pins `default-src 'none'` on the file
#   response itself: direct navigation gets the picture and no script either way.
