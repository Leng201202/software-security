# Midterm written — current KOSEN specimen A

**Course: Software Security 2 (02005094) · Week 8 · 150-minute class slot: 10 minutes administration + 130 minutes working/checking + 10 minutes collection.**

**Raw 100: Basic 50 + Technical 50. Course weight: 8% (4 Basic + 4 Technical).** Covers Weeks 1–6.

This public specimen fixes scope and workload. The instructor uses a separate prepared sitting variant. Answer only the ten questions below. Each is 10 raw points, with a suggested 12 minutes (120 minutes total), then use 10 minutes to review within the 130-minute working window. Administrative time is not additional task time. Use your own explanation and the provided sandbox/code only; permitted aids follow the published sitting notice. Precise mechanisms and tested-design reasoning matter more than memorized catalogue IDs.

## 1. B1 · Basic — 10 points, about 12 minutes

Identify two trust boundaries in browser → application → database. State one confidentiality and one integrity threat; name the appropriate STRIDE classes.

## 2. B2 · Basic — 10 points, about 12 minutes

Given an SQL concatenation finding, a leaked hard-coded token and an outdated dependency, choose SAST / secret scanning / SCA for each. Explain one blind spot of each scanner; distinguish a tool error from a clean result.

## 3. B3 · Basic — 10 points, about 12 minutes

Explain hashing versus encryption versus encoding. For password storage, state why an unsalted fast hash is insufficient and how a successful legacy login can trigger migration.

## 4. B4 · Basic — 10 points, about 12 minutes

Classify these defects and name a matching CWE: SQL string concatenation, raw untrusted HTML text, disabled JWT verification, and missing order ownership checks. State the affected boundary for two.

## 5. B5 · Basic — 10 points, about 12 minutes

Explain authentication versus authorization, least privilege and fail closed. Give one legitimate positive control and one negative control for an owner-only order endpoint.

## 6. T1 · Technical — 10 points, about 12 minutes

A login uses SELECT id FROM users WHERE name='<input>' AND password='<hash>'. In this isolated teaching scenario, explain one boolean-bypass input and why it changes the query. Replace the query with placeholders and bound values; give one negative and one legitimate positive test.

## 7. T2 · Technical — 10 points, about 12 minutes

A diagnostic route runs a shell command assembled from a user-supplied host. Write a design using an argv list, no shell, an IPv4 parser/allowlist and a timeout. Explain why filtering only semicolons is insufficient; give allowed and rejected inputs.

## 8. T3 · Technical — 10 points, about 12 minutes

A page returns <h1>Hello {name}</h1>. Show a correction for this HTML text context. Explain what an HttpOnly cookie changes and what it does not prevent. Give one normal-name test and one XSS-string test.

## 9. T4 · Technical — 10 points, about 12 minutes

A JWT is decoded with verify_signature=False, then its sub selects an order. Specify pinned algorithm/key, required claims, audience/expiry verification, and owner authorization. Give tests for an owner token, another user, and an invalid token.

## 10. T5 · Technical — 10 points, about 12 minutes

A legacy MD5 record is successfully checked at login. Show the Argon2id record update at that point and explain why a failed login must not change it. Describe a safe staged migration and a test showing that the next correct login still works.
