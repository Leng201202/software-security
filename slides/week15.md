# Week 15
## DevSecOps: Putting It Together
Software Security · Nutthakorn Chalaemwongwan

<!-- Final technical teaching week. Hook: configured CI checks can catch selected defects on each run. Today the required core adds a bounded checker and records red-to-green evidence; the full scanner workflow and required merge protection are separate extension/configuration work. ~2 min. -->

---

## Today

- Security in the CI/CD pipeline
- Logging, monitoring & alerting
- Failing safely
- Vulnerability mgmt & disclosure
- 🎮 Game: **Break the Build** (Red vs Blue)

<!-- Roadmap, 1 min. The required local core compares fail-open and fail-closed behavior, implements a student authorization/logging control, and records the same checker red then green. The full Red/Blue scanner game is extension practice. -->

---

## The whole course in one pipeline

- SAST (Wk2) · SCA + image scan (Wk12–13) · IaC (infrastructure-as-code) config scan (Wk13) · secret scanning (Wk2)
- Automated gates instead of one-off scans
- **Secure by Design** as the default

![One app, three layers. You are here: W15. W13, where it runs: a secret baked into an image layer and an IAM policy with Action * on Resource *; fix with a hardened image and least privilege. W14, what it says: the app gets a chatbot; typed text overrides its rules (prompt injection) and its reply goes into the page unescaped (XSS); fix with guardrails, secret redaction and output escaping. W15, how it ships: Semgrep, Trivy and Gitleaks check every push, a red gate fails the PR, and the app denies on error.](img/story-spine.svg)

<!-- The story spine one last time: W13's image and IAM mistakes and W14's injection and XSS are exactly what this pipeline is built to catch on every push. The synthesis slide — walk back through the term: every tool we used by hand now runs automatically on every PR. Manual scanning doesn't scale and humans forget; pipelines don't. ~4 min. -->

---

## One push, three jobs

![The security-ci.yml pipeline at a glance. A push or PR to main starts three jobs in parallel: Semgrep (SAST), Trivy (SCA plus IaC) and Gitleaks (secrets, whole git history). Each job runs the same three phases. The report step never fails (|| true or exit-code "0"). The upload step (if: always()) sends the SARIF to the GitHub Security tab, where every finding of every severity shows. The gate step re-scans and can fail the build. Semgrep's --error and Gitleaks' --exit-code 1 fail on any finding. Trivy's two gates fail only on HIGH or CRITICAL, and the IaC gate is skipped if the SCA gate already failed. The report shows everything; the gate decides.](img/pipeline-at-a-glance.svg)

<!-- Walk it left to right before the YAML: ① report never fails, ② upload always runs, ③ the gate is the step meant to turn the build red — that's Part 2 Q1 in one picture. (An upload can still fail on its own, e.g. a private repo without code scanning — that's why the lab uses a public throwaway repo.) Point at the footnote: the Security tab shows MEDIUM findings like DS-0001 that the gate lets through. ~2 min. -->

---

## A security gate

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-ci.yml
- semgrep   # SAST
- trivy     # SCA (fs) + IaC (config) — image scan is optional, off by default
- gitleaks  # secrets + git history
# each tool runs TWICE: once to report (SARIF, always), once to gate (fails the build)
```

- The token gets only what it needs: `contents: read`, `security-events: write`
- Results (SARIF) go to the GitHub **Security** tab
- A red run **blocks** a merge only if the jobs are **required checks** (branch protection)

```sim
gate-check
```

<!-- The worked example — this is the lab's actual pipeline. Be precise: Trivy's active jobs are fs (SCA) and config (IaC) — the image-scan step exists in the YAML but is commented out/optional, don't claim it's active. The "runs twice" pattern (report step + separate gate step) is what Part 2 Q1 is built around — say it explicitly. The sim's 2 decoys are the actual worksheet nuance: chmod 777 has no Trivy rule at any severity, while FROM:latest IS detected (DS-0001) but rated MEDIUM and filtered by severity:HIGH,CRITICAL — same green build, different reason. The gate conditions differ by tool: Semgrep selected-rule findings, Trivy HIGH/CRITICAL, Gitleaks detections. A gate that only warns gets ignored. ~6 min. -->

---

## Platform option — GitHub Advanced Security

- **CodeQL** code scanning (SAST) on every PR
- **Secret scanning** + push protection
- **Dependabot** for vulnerable deps
- **SonarQube** as a quality/SAST gate alongside

> Same idea as the YAML gate — managed, in the repo.

<!-- The managed equivalent they'll meet in industry. Same concept, less YAML to maintain. Mention SonarQube as the common quality-gate they'll see in internships. ~3 min. -->

---

## Logging, monitoring, alerting

- **A09:2025** — without logs you can't detect or respond
- Log security events (authn, authz failures, anomalies)
- **Never log the secret/token value itself** (CWE-532) — log `reason=bad_token`, not the token
- Alert on suspicious patterns

<!-- Shift from prevention to detection. A09 (logging/monitoring failures) is a Top 10 risk because you can't respond to what you can't see. The CWE-532 point is graded (Part 2 Q4) and easy to skip if you only say "log security events" — a log line that captures the bad token has just created a new secrets-in-logs problem. Recall W6: we read attacker actions FROM logs — but only if they were logged. ~4 min. -->

---

## Detection tooling

- **NIDS** (network intrusion detection) — Snort / Suricata watch network traffic
- **HIDS** (host intrusion detection) — OSSEC watches one machine
- **SIEM** (collects and connects alerts) — Security Onion bundles these tools
- Network visibility: **TAP** (lossless) vs **SPAN** (cheap, can drop)

<!-- Awareness of the defender's toolkit. NIDS watches the wire, HIDS watches the host, SIEM correlates everything. TAP vs SPAN is a practical gotcha: SPAN ports drop packets under load — you miss attacks. Keep brisk. ~3 min. -->

---

## Alerts — the confusion matrix

| | Incident real | No incident |
|---|---|---|
| **Alert fired** | True positive ✅ | False positive |
| **No alert** | **False negative** 💀 | True negative |

- False negative = worst case (missed attack)
- Some false positives are inevitable — tune, don't silence

<!-- Ties back to W2 triage. The danger asymmetry: a false negative = an attack you never saw. But too many false positives → alert fatigue → analysts mute everything → effective false negatives. The skill is TUNING. ~4 min. -->

---

## When something happens (NIST SP 800-86)

**Collection → Examination → Analysis → Reporting**

- Collect what disappears first (**order of volatility**): memory → temp files → disk → logs
- Failed/success logins: Windows Event **4625 / 4624**

<!-- A taste of incident response / forensics. Order of volatility: capture RAM before you pull the plug — it's gone on shutdown. 4625 (failed) / 4624 (success) are the login events they'd grep in a real investigation. ~4 min. -->

---

## Fail safely

- **A10:2025** — mishandled errors leak info / fail open
- **Fail closed:** deny on error, don't bypass checks
- Don't expose stack traces / secrets in errors

<!-- A design principle that recurs: when something breaks, DENY (fail closed), don't accidentally grant access (fail open). Verbose errors leak schema/secrets (recall W4 error-based enumeration). ~3 min. -->

---

## Vulnerability management & disclosure

- Triage by severity; track to remediation (SLAs)
- **Coordinated disclosure** & bug bounties
- security.txt; a path for researchers to report

<!-- The professional/ethical close: finding a bug is step one; managing it to a fix (with SLAs) is the job. Coordinated disclosure + security.txt = how to receive reports responsibly. Connects to the course ethics theme. ~3 min. -->

---

## One decision, made twice

![Two panels showing the same yes-or-no decision at two different times. Build time: the CI gate's HIGH/CRITICAL severity filter, not the scanner itself, decides what a build refuses — root user (DS-0002, HIGH) is caught, :latest (DS-0001, MEDIUM) slips past the filter. Run time: the /admin handler makes the identical decision on an exception — fail-open returns 200 and logs nothing (silent bypass, A09); fail-closed returns 403 and logs event=authz_failure without ever logging the token itself (CWE-532). At build time, letting MEDIUM through is a risk decision — fine if someone made it on purpose, a gap if nobody looked. At run time, the except branch that returns 200 is the actual fail-open bug: A10, CWE-636.](img/fail-closed.svg)

<!-- The synthesis slide, and arguably the whole course's closing argument: "secure by default" means someone has to have DECIDED the default, twice here — once in YAML severity filters, once in an except block. Keep the two apart: a severity threshold is a policy someone can defend (or not), while an except branch that grants access on error is a bug (A10, CWE-636). Walk both panels, land on the bottom line before the game. ~5 min. -->

---

## Try it — same request, two services

Pick a token. Both real services answer, and you see what each one logs.

```sim
fail-open
```

<!-- Interactive companion to the diagram above; every response and log line was captured from the real :8090/:8091 containers. Click "no token" (8090 leaks, 8091 logs a WARNING), then "user, not admin" (both deny: the bug lives only on the error path), then "real admin" (both unlock). ~3 min. -->

---

## 🔴🔵 Extension game — Break the Build

- **Blue:** set up the gate (Semgrep selected-rule findings, Trivy HIGH/CRITICAL, Gitleaks detected secrets), log security events and deny on lookup error
- **Red:** one planted defect per PR — an old dependency (Trivy SCA), a Dockerfile running as root (Trivy config), or a hard-coded token (Gitleaks)
- **Score:** Blue +1 per catch · Red +1 per defect that slips through (e.g. `chmod 777`, `FROM :latest` stay green) — then propose a rule that would catch it
- **Flag:** leak it from the fail-open `/admin` in `insecure_service.py` (local run = public demo flag; personal flag only if an instance is actually issued)

<!-- The full scanner game remains extended project practice. In class, capture one prepared bounded checker red result and a corrected green result; keep the legitimate-admin positive control and safe-log evidence. Game points do not add to the worksheet rubric. -->

---

## Break the Build — what each change turns red

![The Break the Build game board, measured by running security-ci.yml's own gate commands on the real lab files. Columns: Semgrep gate, Trivy SCA gate, Trivy IaC gate, Gitleaks gate. Blue's baseline is red before Red does anything: unpinned @v4/@v3 action tags and host="0.0.0.0" trip Semgrep, and the docs' own curl examples with the toy alice-token header trip Gitleaks' curl-auth-header (a false positive). Red's attacks, one per PR on Blue's green baseline: urllib3==1.24.1 trips only Trivy SCA (7 HIGH, e.g. CVE-2019-11324). A Dockerfile running as root trips Trivy IaC (DS-0002 HIGH) and also Semgrep (missing-user or last-user-is-root). A ghp_ GitHub token trips Gitleaks (github-pat) and also Trivy SCA, whose secret scanner rates it CRITICAL. Decoys stay green: chmod 777 has no rule, and FROM python:latest is DS-0001 MEDIUM, which the gate filters out.](img/break-the-build-board.svg)

<!-- The rules of the game on one board. Top rows = Task 3 (Blue must clear these first or every Red PR is already red); dashed cells = cross-hits, one defect turning two jobs red. ~2 min. -->

---

## Try it — which job goes red?

Click **Blue's clean baseline**, then **Red: old urllib3**, and find the gate that fails.

```sim
red-team-pr
```

<!-- Click "untouched lab" first: Semgrep + Gitleaks are red before Red does anything. Then "Blue's clean baseline", then each Red preset. End on "two defects in one PR": the IaC gate shows skipped, which is why the worksheet says one defect per PR. ~3 min. -->

---

## Task 1b at a glance

![Task 1b at a glance. Build the lab image before class; Flask is already inside it. From the lab folder, docker compose up --no-build --pull never starts two containers from that image, both mounting the lab folder: insecure_service.py on localhost:8090 and secure_service.py on localhost:8091. Send both the same GET /admin with no token. :8090 answers 200 with the panel and the FLAG, because the USERS dictionary lookup raises KeyError and the except branch grants access; its log shows only a 200 access line. :8091 answers 403 forbidden and logs a WARNING on the security logger (event=authz_failure outcome=deny reason=unauthenticated). Then prove the fix keeps admins in: alice-token still unlocks :8091, and the local positive/negative controls check both. Submit the flag, both responses and the failing-open except line; a local run returns the public demo flag, a personal one applies only if an instance was actually issued.](img/lab-at-a-glance-kosen.svg)

<!-- The lab briefing for the required local core: prebuild before class; start with docker compose up --no-build --pull never; compare both ports; inspect logs; verify alice-token still works. ~2 min. -->

## Deliverable

> 📋 **Worksheet 15** — `labs/week15-devsecops-pipeline/worksheet.md` · follow the 100-minute core run sheet.

- Your bounded `student_task.py` fail-closed and safe-log change
- `python3 check_student.py` results: deny missing/invalid/error cases while preserving legitimate admin access
- One prepared `student-check-ci.yml` red run and corrected green run under the same checks; record the local equivalent if CI is unavailable
- Full scanner workflow and all three planted-defect families: extended project practice
- **Assigned written version only:** Conventional Part 2/4 (20/20) or AIR Audit/EiPE/Prompt (20/10/10), after the shared practical 60.

<!-- A hosted verifier/personal instance exists only when explicitly issued. Public demo flags are observations, not personal proof. The prepared bounded checker and full Semgrep/Trivy/Gitleaks workflow have different scopes. -->

---

## Key takeaways

- Automate security gates — humans forget, pipelines don't
- You can't defend what you don't log
- Fail closed; disclose responsibly

<!-- Recap + course wrap of the technical units. Cold-call: "why must the gate FAIL the build, not just warn?" (warnings get ignored). ~2 min. -->

# Questions?
Next week: Capstone studio & CTF warm-up

<!-- Wrap: "Teaching is done — next is your capstone: ship something secure, then defend it in the final CTF. Bring your project to the studio." -->

## Current class hand-in

**Class:** quiz/review 10 + explanation/demo 15 + supervised practice 100 + debrief 20 + evidence capture 5 minutes. Prepare tools, images and access before class. The full reference tasks remain below; their standalone estimates are not an instruction to finish the entire bank during the class.

**Assessment:** all students complete the shared practical **60/100** plus **one assigned version's 40/100**. Conventional uses the ordinary Part 2 questions (20) and Part 4 reflection (20). AIR-Sec uses Audit-the-AI (20), Explain-in-Plain-English (10) and Prompt Problem (10). The unassigned written version is reference practice, not an extra requirement. Each teaching worksheet contributes **2.5 course points**, making 12 individual worksheets worth 30 in total.

Both versions submit their own commands/results and explanation, and complete the student patch and control tests where assigned. Personal flags are used only for an actually issued instance; a local demo flag alone does not demonstrate understanding. Viva/reproduction checks verify the existing work within its rubric: no additional points or automatic-zero gate.


**100-minute core run sheet (time, not points):** Compare fail-open/closed 20; student authorization/logging fix 20; one prepared CI red run 30; corrected green/control run 20; evidence 10. The practical rubric is 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 points.

Complete the bounded fail-closed/logging functions in `student_task.py` and run `python3 check_student.py`. Add that same command as a job step in the prepared lab repository: first retain its failing run, then the corrected passing run. A local run is the required fallback when an external CI queue is unavailable, under the same criteria. The existing full scanner workflow and all three defect families remain extended project practice. No new public repository, PR or external service is created by running the local checker. Test a legitimate admin as well as missing, unknown, non-admin and lookup-error cases.
