# Week 13
## Cloud & Container Security
Software Security · Nutthakorn Chalaemwongwan

<!-- Hook: most cloud breaches aren't clever zero-days — they're a public S3 bucket or a `*:*` IAM policy. Today we hunt and fix those misconfigs. ~2 min. -->

---

## Today

- Shared-responsibility model
- IAM (who can do what) & least privilege
- Secrets management
- Container/image hardening
- 🎮 Game: **Misconfig Hunt**

<!-- Roadmap, 1 min. Theme: the cloud is secure; your CONFIGURATION usually isn't. Lab = find + fix misconfigurations, each one a flag. -->

---

## Recap & framing

- Supply chain → what you build with
- Today → where you run it
- **OWASP A02:2025 Security Misconfiguration** (now #2)

![One app, three layers. You are here: W13. W13, where it runs: a secret baked into an image layer and an IAM policy with Action * on Resource *; fix with a hardened image and least privilege. W14, what it says: the app gets a chatbot; typed text overrides its rules (prompt injection) and its reply goes into the page unescaped (XSS); fix with guardrails, secret redaction and output escaping. W15, how it ships: Semgrep, Trivy and Gitleaks check every push, a red gate fails the PR, and the app denies on error.](img/story-spine.svg)

<!-- 1-min bridge. Misconfiguration jumped to A02 in 2025 — it's not a footnote, it's the second most critical web risk. Then the story spine: one app, three layers — today we package it and give it cloud permissions (W13), next we add an AI chatbot to it (W14), last we put a pipeline in front of all of it (W15). Same root mistake all day: trusting input and defaults nobody checked. ~2 min. -->

---

## Shared responsibility

- The provider secures the cloud itself; you secure what you put in it
- Misconfig — not provider bugs — causes most breaches
- Defaults are rarely safe

<!-- The mental model students most misunderstand: AWS secures the hardware/hypervisor; YOU secure your buckets, IAM, security groups. Almost every headline cloud breach is the customer's config, not the provider. ~4 min. -->

---

## Whose job is it?

![Shared responsibility for this lab's S3-backed app as two panels split by a line. AWS secures OF the cloud: data centres and hardware, the hypervisor and host OS, the S3 and IAM services themselves, the global network. You secure what you put IN it: the IAM policy (iam-policy-insecure.json, 3 flags), the container image (Dockerfile.insecure, 6 flags including the ENV secret), bucket access and encryption, and network rules such as 0.0.0.0/0 on a database port. Conclusion: all 9 Misconfig Hunt flags sit in your half; none is a provider bug.](img/shared-responsibility.svg)

<!-- Point at the line, then at the two pills: every file the students touch today is on the right. Ask "which of the 9 flags could AWS have fixed for you?" — none. ~2 min. -->

---

## IAM & least privilege

```json
{ "Effect":"Allow", "Action":"*", "Resource":"*" }   // 🚩
```

- Read a statement as: **Effect** (allow or deny) · **Action** (what) · **Resource** (on which thing) · **Condition** (only when …)
- `Resource:"*"` → **CWE-732**, `Action:"*"` → **CWE-269**: graded as **two** findings on the same policy
- Fix: use two statements for one bucket. Allow `s3:GetObject` on `app/*`. Allow `s3:ListBucket` only when the `s3:prefix` `Condition` matches `app/*`

```sim
iam-scope
```

<!-- The worked example — this `*:*` policy is the Misconfig Hunt round 1 and the quiz. If a credential with this leaks, the attacker owns everything. This is 100% manual review — Trivy's config scanner does not parse standalone IAM JSON at all, say so explicitly so students don't wait for a scanner to flag it. The sim scores Action and Resource independently, live, so "two findings, not one" is something they watch instead of a claim on a slide. Least privilege = smallest possible blast radius. ~6 min. -->

---

## If the key leaks — blast radius

![The same AWS account drawn twice at the same scale. Left, iam-policy-insecure.json (Action star, Resource star, no Condition): the whole account is allowed, with example actions a leaked key can now run — s3 star on any bucket, iam:CreateAccessKey to mint new keys that survive rotation, ec2:RunInstances on your bill, kms:Decrypt, cloudtrail:StopLogging to turn off the audit trail — equals full admin; Action star is CWE-269, Resource star is CWE-732. Right, iam-policy-leastpriv.json: everything is implicitly denied except a small app/* square inside lab-app-bucket, readable via s3:GetObject on app/* objects, plus s3:ListBucket only under the Condition s3:prefix = app/*. Trivy parses neither file; Task 2 is manual review.](img/iam-blast-radius.svg)

<!-- The answer to the cold-call "what does *:* cost you if the key leaks?", drawn. Land on iam:CreateAccessKey: rotating the leaked key doesn't evict an attacker who already minted their own. Right side = iam-policy-leastpriv.json, line for line. ~2 min. -->

---

## Secrets management

- Secrets in env vars / Dockerfile / git = leaked
- The lab's `ENV API_TOKEN` maps to **CWE-526** (environment exposure), **CWE-798** (hard-coded credential) and possible **CWE-200** disclosure.
- Use a secrets manager / vault; rotate
- Scan history (Gitleaks) — recall Week 2

<!-- Connect to W2 (Gitleaks) and W12. A secret baked into an image layer is in every copy of that image forever — `docker history` reveals it. Fix = inject at runtime from a vault + rotate. ~4 min. -->

---

## Where the ENV secret ends up

![From a real build of week13-insecure:lab, the image history as a stack with the newest layer on top: CMD, EXPOSE, RUN chmod -R 777, RUN pip install, COPY dot dot, WORKDIR, then ENV AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and ENV API_TOKEN, both 0 bytes because the value lives in the image config, then the python:latest base layers. Arrows to three readouts: plain docker history still prints sk_live_supersecret_DO_NOT_DO_ (30 of 34 characters); docker history --no-trunc prints the whole token (the Task 3 command); docker inspect .Config.Env prints both keys in full. A fourth arrow: COPY dot dot copied Dockerfile.insecure itself into /app, so the secret is in a file too. Fix: never put the secret in the Dockerfile, inject it at run time, and rotate the key because every pushed image keeps the old value.](img/image-layer-leak.svg)

<!-- Two misconceptions to kill: "truncated history hides it" (it prints 30 of 34 characters) and "delete it in a later layer" (0B — it's config, not a file). Then the bonus leak: COPY . . shipped the Dockerfile itself. ~3 min. -->

---

## Try it — which layer gives it away?

Real `docker history` / `docker inspect` output from both lab images. Start with `docker history --no-trunc` and compare the ENV rows.

```sim
image-layers
```

<!-- Drive it: insecure + "docker history" (still leaks) → "--no-trunc" (Task 3) → "ls -la /app" (Dockerfile.insecure is in the image). Then flip to hardened: no secret row, no build stage, and no ls at all — distroless. Output was captured from real builds, nothing runs live. ~3 min. -->

---

## Storage & network exposure

- Public buckets, open ports, default creds
- Encrypt at rest + in transit
- Private by default; explicit allow

<!-- `0.0.0.0/0` permits any IPv4 source in that security-group rule; routing, other firewalls and service binding still affect actual reachability. Default creds add another risk. Principle: deny by default, open deliberately (echoes W6 access control). ~4 min. -->

---

## Container image hardening

```bash
# Required offline core: pre-pull aquasec/trivy:latest before class
docker run --rm --network none --pull never -v "$PWD:/src:ro" aquasec/trivy:latest \
  config --skip-check-update --severity MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL /src
# Image CVE scanning is an online/database-prepared extension
```

- **Two stages:** build in `python:3.11-slim`, run in **distroless** (no shell, no package manager) as user `65532`, not root
- **Pin by digest** (`@sha256:...`): a tag can be moved later, a digest cannot
- A digest pins bytes, **not** safety or provenance. `:latest` is mutable; it is **not automatically CWE-1104** unless the selected component is unmaintained.
- **Trivy finds only 3 of the 6 defects.** `COPY . .`, `chmod -R 777` and unpinned `pip install`: **read the file**

<!-- Hands-on — run the offline config scan against the lab folder after the image was pulled before class. Check that the report actually lists the Dockerfiles and findings; a missing report is not zero findings. Image CVE scanning needs a prepared database and is extension work. IAM JSON remains manual review. ~5 min. -->

---

## Does Trivy see it?

Start with **fix only what Trivy flags**: Trivy says 0, but 3 defects are still in the file. Then fix the rest one at a time.

```sim
trivy-blindspot
```

<!-- Press "fix only what Trivy flags": Failures 0, three defects still in the file — a clean scan is not a clean image. Then "a tag, not a digest": DS-0001 passes python:3.11-slim, but harden.md row 1 wants @sha256. Rules checked against real Trivy 0.76.1 on all 96 combinations: 4 → 0 matches scan.sh. ~4 min. -->

---

## Kubernetes basics (awareness)

- Pod security (a pod = one or more containers run together), network policies, RBAC (role-based access control)
- Don't run privileged; limit service-account tokens

<!-- Awareness only (K8s is its own course). Key takeaways: a privileged pod ≈ host root; mounted service-account tokens are a lateral-movement prize. Keep it brief. ~3 min. -->

---

## Same app, shipped twice

![The same app as two container images side by side, insecure vs hardened, six layers compared: mutable :latest tag vs a pinned digest, a baked-in secret vs runtime injection, root user vs distroless non-root, COPY-everything vs a minimal context, world-writable permissions vs read-only, and an unpinned pip install vs a discarded build stage. Below both, the same argument one layer up: the wildcard IAM policy vs the scoped one. The conclusion: Trivy flags only three of the seven defects shown here — the tag, the root user, and the secret. COPY .., chmod 777, the unpinned install, and the IAM JSON all need manual review; there is no rule for any of them.](img/container-hardening.svg)

<!-- Walk the container and IAM rows. Cite actual scanner output for detected rules; review COPY, chmod, unpinned install and IAM manually. Scanner coverage is an observation for this prepared lab image and checks, not a universal rule count. ~5 min. -->

---

## 🔍 Game — Misconfig Hunt

**9 flags** — each misconfiguration **found + explained** = a flag:

1. **Container (6):** `:latest` tag, root user, secret-in-ENV, `COPY . .`, `chmod -R 777`, unpinned `pip install`
2. **IAM (3):** `Resource:"*"` (CWE-732), `Action:"*"` (CWE-269), missing `Condition` scoping

<!-- Explain before lab: 9 flags total, two categories only — no separate bucket/storage flag, no IaC/localstack target exists in this lab. Find AND explain (why it's a finding, which fix applies) = the flag. Q6 of the quiz asks for one misconfig they explained + the principle it violated. ~3 min. -->

---

## Deliverable

> 📋 **Worksheet 13** — `labs/week13-cloud-container/worksheet.md` · follow the 100-minute core run sheet.

- Selected Dockerfile scanner findings plus manual configuration/IAM review
- Your `student_task.py` least-privilege policy diff and `python3 check_student.py` allow/deny controls
- Explain the bounded local evaluator's limits; do not claim deployed AWS permissions were tested
- **Assigned written version only:** Conventional Part 2/4 (20/20) or AIR Audit/EiPE/Prompt (20/10/10), after the shared practical 60.

---

## Key takeaways

- Misconfiguration > zero-days as a breach cause
- Least privilege, private-by-default, no secrets in code
- Scan infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files and images in CI

<!-- Recap. Cold-call: "what does a `*:*` IAM policy cost you if the key leaks?" (everything — full blast radius). "Scan in CI" sets up W15. ~2 min. -->

## Current class hand-in

**Class:** quiz/review 10 + explanation/demo 15 + supervised practice 100 + debrief 20 + evidence capture 5 minutes. Prepare tools, images and access before class. The full reference tasks remain below; their standalone estimates are not an instruction to finish the entire bank during the class.

**Assessment:** all students complete the shared practical **60/100** plus **one assigned version's 40/100**. Conventional uses the ordinary Part 2 questions (20) and Part 4 reflection (20). AIR-Sec uses Audit-the-AI (20), Explain-in-Plain-English (10) and Prompt Problem (10). The unassigned written version is reference practice, not an extra requirement. Each teaching worksheet contributes **2.5 course points**, making 12 individual worksheets worth 30 in total.

Both versions submit their own commands/results and explanation, and complete the student patch and control tests where assigned. Personal flags are used only for an actually issued instance; a local demo flag alone does not demonstrate understanding. Viva/reproduction checks verify the existing work within its rubric: no additional points or automatic-zero gate.


**100-minute core run sheet (time, not points):** Scan the selected Dockerfile 20; manual container/IAM review 20; student least-privilege policy 35; allow/deny controls and explanation 25. The practical rubric is 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 points.

Implement `build_policy()` in `student_task.py` and run `python3 check_student.py`. Submit your policy, a diff and permitted/denied example results. The checker is a deliberately bounded evaluator for this exercise, **not AWS IAM policy simulation or proof of deployed permissions**. Real AWS authorization, permissions boundaries, SCPs and runtime controls are outside this local static case. Keep the Dockerfile scan versus manual IAM-review distinction from the original tasks.
