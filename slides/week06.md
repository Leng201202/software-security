# Week 6
## Authentication, Sessions & Access Control
Software Security 2 · Nutthakorn Chalaemwongwan · Shinya Oyama

<!-- Hook: change /orders/1 to /2 and read a stranger's data — promise that demo. The #1 web risk in 2025 is Broken Access Control, and it's mostly missing one check. ~2 min. -->

---

## Today

**KOSEN class: 150 minutes.** Quiz/review 10 + brief/demo 15 + practical 100 + debrief 20 + capture 5. Full slide explanations are preparation/reference.

**Worksheet:** common practical 60 + assigned Conventional written 40 **or** AIR-Sec Audit 20 / EiPE 10 / Prompt 10. Each totals 100; viva verifies understanding within the rubric. Extensions add no graded points.


- Authn vs authz
- Session management & JWT pitfalls
- OAuth2 / OIDC at a glance
- IDOR & broken access control
- 🎮 Game: **IDOR Treasure Hunt + JWT Forgery**

<!-- Roadmap, 1 min. This is the last teaching week before review/midterm. Lab = exploit IDOR + forge a JWT, then implement object ownership and proper token verification. -->

---

## Recap — Week 5

- XSS steals sessions → today we manage them
- Client-side trust is limited — enforce on the server

<!-- 1-min bridge. XSS could steal a session token; today: what IS that token, and how do we stop theft + misuse? Theme of the week: enforce on the server, every request. -->

---

## Authn vs Authz

- **Authentication** — *who are you?* (login, MFA)
- **Authorization** — *what are you allowed to do?*
- Most breaches today are **authz** failures
- Maps to **A01 Broken Access Control**, **A07 Authentication Failures**

<!-- The distinction students most often blur — make them repeat it. Authn = identity; authz = permission. A01 is #1 in OWASP 2025 precisely because authz checks get forgotten. Ask for an example of each failing. ~5 min. -->

---

## Sessions

- Server issues a session token after login
- Classic pattern: stored in a cookie (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`)
- Risks: fixation, predictable IDs, **no expiry**, no logout invalidation
- **Today's lab is 100% JWT bearer-token — no cookies at all.** Of these four risks, only "no expiry" is what you'll actually exercise (the fix adds a 15-min `exp` claim); fixation/predictable-ID/logout-invalidation are cookie-session concepts, general knowledge, not tested here

<!-- Connect cookie flags to W5: HttpOnly stops XSS theft, SameSite restricts cross-site cookie attachment; a server-side authorization/CSRF check is still needed, Secure forces HTTPS. Be upfront that this lab doesn't touch cookies — don't let students expect a cookie-based task today. Explain session fixation briefly (attacker sets the id before login) as general knowledge. ~5 min. -->

---

## JWT pitfalls

- `alg: none` accepted → forge any token
- Weak/guessable HMAC secret → re-sign
- Not checking `exp` / `aud` / signature at all
- Sensitive data in payload (it's only base64!)

```sim
jwt-forge
```

<!-- The sim IS the "decode a JWT live" demo — edit the payload, watch base64url decode instantly (not encrypted), then flip alg to none and watch a server that trusts the header accept it. Emphasize: never put secrets in the payload. This is the JWT Forgery game, live. ~7 min. -->

---

## The fix: verify the signature — one check, every endpoint

```python
# vulnerable: 'none' allowed + weak secret -> any forged token passes
if alg == "none": jwt.decode(token, options={"verify_signature": False})
SECRET = "secret"

# fixed: pin the algorithm, strong secret, require sub + exp + aud
jwt.decode(token, SECRET, algorithms=["HS256"],
           audience=AUD, options={"require": ["sub", "exp", "aud"]})
```

- base64url is **encoding, not a seal** — only the signature check stops forgery
- Pin `algorithms=["HS256"]` (never `"none"`) + a strong random secret from env
- Fix it in **one place** (`current_user`) → every endpoint is covered at once

<!-- Parallel to Wk4's parameterize slide. The break was never that the payload is readable (base64url always is) — it's that the server trusted a token whose signature it didn't properly check. alg:none says 'no signature' and a vulnerable server obeys; a weak secret ('secret') lets anyone RE-sign. Both defeat the ONE thing that matters: does the signature verify under a key only we hold? Fix: pin HS256 so 'none' is rejected, use a strong random secret from the environment, and require exp+aud so a stray token can't be replayed. Punch line, and the analog of 'parameterize once': this fix lives in current_user(), so the moment you fix it, /api/orders AND /api/admin are both protected — there is no per-endpoint patch to forget. Never put secrets in the payload. ~6 min. -->

---

## JWT forgery in one picture

![A JWT is header.payload.signature in base64url: the header and payload are readable and editable by anyone, only the signature is a seal. Two forgeries: alg:none sets an empty signature and a vulnerable server skips the check and accepts sub:admin; a weak secret lets the attacker re-sign sub:admin so the signature verifies. The fix pins algorithms to HS256, uses a strong secret, and requires exp and aud, so both forged tokens return 401 — and because the check lives in current_user it covers every endpoint at once.](img/jwt-signed-not-sealed.svg)

<!-- Consolidation slide — leave it up during the JWT Forgery lab. It shows the whole story: the payload is always readable (blue), so the bug is never 'they saw the data' — it's a signature that wasn't verified. Point at the orange empty signature (alg:none) and the orange HMAC(secret) (weak key), then the blue fix line: pin HS256, strong secret, require exp+aud. Same story the jwt-forge sim animates live. Land the punch line: signed, not sealed. ~3 min. -->

---

## OAuth2 / OIDC (high level)

- Delegated access via tokens — don't share passwords
- OIDC adds identity (ID token) on top of OAuth2
- Common bugs: open redirect, missing state, token leakage

<!-- Keep high-level (full OAuth is its own course). Key idea: "Login with Google" = delegation, you never give the app your Google password. The `state` parameter prevents CSRF on the callback. ~4 min. -->

---

## IDOR & broken access control

```text
GET /api/orders/1   → your order
GET /api/orders/2   → someone else's  😱
```

- Object reference with no ownership check
- Vertical (become admin) vs horizontal (other users)

<!-- The worked example — this is the IDOR Treasure Hunt. The server authenticated you but never checked the object BELONGS to you. Horizontal = peer data; vertical = privilege escalation. ~6 min. -->

---

## The fix: check ownership — a valid token is not permission

```python
# vulnerable: authenticated, but the result is thrown away -> no Gate 2
def get_order(oid):
    current_user()                 # WHO you are...
    return jsonify(ORDERS[oid])    # ...but never 'may you see THIS?'

# fixed: deny-by-default ownership check on every object access
    if order["owner"] != user: return 403
```

- Authentication answers **who**; authorization answers **may you touch THIS object**
- alice's real, valid token must **still** be refused bob's order
- Check ownership at **every** object access — deny by default

<!-- The IDOR fix mechanism. The vulnerable get_order literally CALLS current_user() and throws the answer away — Gate 1 runs, Gate 2 doesn't exist. Drive it home: this is an authorization bug, alice really is alice; being authenticated was treated as permission to read any object. The one-line fix compares the object's owner to the caller and denies by default. Emphasize every object access and centralize the check so one forgotten endpoint does not reopen it. ~5 min. -->

---

## One request, two gates

![One HTTP request must pass two gates. Gate 1, authentication: verify the token's signature and algorithm — broken by alg:none and a weak hardcoded secret, so a forged token passes. Gate 2, authorization: does the caller own THIS object — broken because the ownership check never runs. The key point: even a perfectly valid, genuine token clears Gate 1 but must not be enough to clear Gate 2 on its own — alice's own valid login token can still read bob's order if Gate 2 is missing.](img/authn-vs-authz.svg)

<!-- The thesis of the whole week, made concrete: JWT pitfalls broke Gate 1, IDOR broke Gate 2, and they're independent failures — fixing one doesn't fix the other. This is why "Defenses" lists both "verify JWT" and "check ownership" as separate bullets, not one fix. ~4 min. -->

---

## Access control models

- **MAC** — Mandatory: system-enforced labels (military)
- **DAC** — Discretionary: owner grants access (file perms)
- **RBAC** — Role-Based: permissions via roles
- **RuBAC** — Rule-Based: conditions (time of day, IP)

> Best practices: separation of duties · least privilege · implicit deny

<!-- Quick taxonomy — general knowledge. Today's lab does NOT implement RBAC/ABAC: the actual fix is a flat ownership check (`order["owner"] != user`), no roles or permissions structure at all. Don't tell students they'll build RBAC today; they won't. Stress the three best-practice principles — especially implicit deny (default to no access). ~4 min. -->

---

## Exercise — RBAC

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Developer | Read/write Git, JIRA, run unit tests |
| QA Engineer | Read Git, write test reports, JIRA, **deploy to staging** |
| Project Manager | Read Git, JIRA, view dashboard |
| Intern | Read Git, run unit tests |

1. Who may deploy to staging?
2. An intern must create bug entries — which role's perms to add?
3. List all roles that can modify the codebase.

<!-- Run this interactively — give 2 minutes, then poll answers. (1) QA only. (2) add JIRA-write, narrowly (least privilege, not a full role bump). (3) Developer (write Git); discuss whether QA's staging deploy counts. ~6 min. -->

## Reading the attack in the logs

Reconstruct the kill chain from Apache logs:

```text
GET /login.php?username=' or 1=1 limit 1; -- a&...   302   ← SQLi admin
POST /upload.php                                     200   ← backdoor
GET /uploads/backdoor.php?cmd=ls%20-l                200   ← RCE
```

- `%20` = space (URL-decode!) · logs let you trace what happened

<!-- Ties W4 (SQLi auth bypass + upload→RCE) into incident response. Walk the three lines as a story: get in → plant webshell → run commands. Teach URL-decoding (%20=space). Defenders read logs; attackers leave them. ~5 min. -->

---

## CWE mapping

- **CWE-639** — IDOR / missing ownership check
- **CWE-347** — improper signature verification (`alg:none` forgery)
- **CWE-321** — use of a hardcoded/weak cryptographic key (the guessable HMAC secret)

<!-- Reference for the worksheet — these three are what's actually graded (worksheet header + Q1). CWE-321 is easy to drop since it's not the "obvious" JWT CWE, but it's the weak-secret task's specific id. ~1 min. -->

---

## Defenses

- **Server-side authorization on every request** (deny by default)
- Check ownership, not just authentication
- Strong session tokens + proper expiry/rotation
- Verify JWT signature, `alg`, `exp`, `aud`; keep secrets strong
- RBAC / ABAC enforced centrally
- **Centralize** the check — don't scatter `if role==...` everywhere

<!-- The payoff. #1: authorize EVERY request, deny by default. "Check ownership, not just authentication" is the IDOR fix in one line. Centralize so you can't forget a check on one endpoint. ~6 min. -->

---

## Tool — Burp Suite workflow

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| **Proxy** | intercept & modify requests |
| **Repeater** | replay/tweak one request |
| **Intruder** | automate brute-force/fuzz |
| **Decoder/Comparer** | encode payloads / diff responses |

- Set **scope**, intercept, change a value (e.g. `price=1`), forward
- Test auth, sessions, **IDOR**, privilege escalation

<!-- Practical — they'll use Repeater to tweak object ids and Intruder to enumerate. Demo: intercept, change orders/1→2, forward, see another user's data. Set scope first so you don't attack out-of-bounds. ~5 min. -->

---

## 🗺️ Game — IDOR Treasure Hunt + JWT Forgery

1. Tamper object IDs to reach **another user's** data (horizontal — read bob's order) → the local flag is demo evidence; use only an individually issued hosted flag when assigned
2. Forge a JWT two ways: `alg:none`, then sign with the exposed weak HMAC secret
3. **Defend:** complete `student_patch.py`, then use `student_checks.py` to prove legitimate access works and cross-user or forged-token access fails. Compare `solution_app.py` only after your own tests.

<!-- Explain before lab. Treasure hunt = change the order id with alice's real token: horizontal access to bob's order. The local demo flag is shared practice, not proof from an individually assigned hosted instance. Worksheet Task 4 is optional, ungraded admin-forgery practice; Task 5's common-core controls still verify that a real non-admin user gets 403 and forged tokens get 401 on /api/admin. The common core includes student-written JWT verification and object ownership in student_patch.py; the pre-written solution stays a comparison. Do not mislabel object ownership as a complete RBAC system. ~3 min. -->

---

## Lab steps

> 📋 **Worksheet 6** — `labs/week06-authn-authz/worksheet.md` (Part 3) · **before class:** `docker compose build` · **kickoff:** `docker compose up --no-build --pull never` → http://localhost:8080

1. Find IDOR endpoints; enumerate other users' objects
2. Forge a JWT (`alg:none` AND signing with the exposed weak HMAC secret — two separate graded observations)
3. Complete the JWT verification and ownership TODOs in `student_patch.py`
4. Run `student_checks.py` in the prepared image before and after the patch; explain the positive and negative results

<!-- Logistics. The graded defense is the student's verification and ownership patch with positive and negative checks. solution_app.py remains the complete reference. The weekly quiz no longer asks for the object id/fix/flag (dropped — quiz runs before the lab) — that's required in the worksheet instead. Also the NoteVault project access-control task. -->

---

## Deliverable

- IDOR + JWT findings with impact
- Your `student_patch.py` commit and `student_checks.py` results
- Proof legitimate access works and forged-token / cross-user access fails
- **Assigned AIR-Sec 40: Audit / EiPE / Prompt; Conventional uses written 40** (see worksheet)

<!-- Before/after + proof must come from the student's patch. The supplied solution is comparison material. -->

---

## Key takeaways

- Authenticate once, **authorize every request**
- Never trust client-supplied IDs or tokens blindly
- Deny by default

<!-- Recap. Cold-call: "we authenticated the user — why can they still read another user's order?" (no ownership/authz check). ~2 min. -->

# Questions?
Next week: Reflection & review (midterm prep)

<!-- Wrap the teaching block: "Next week we consolidate W1-6 — Jeopardy + a mock CTF in the exact midterm format. Bring your cheat-sheet of CWEs." Remind cumulative review quiz in W7. -->

<!-- Current authored work: student_patch.py plus student_checks.py, positive and negative controls, and an explanation. Reference-only output does not demonstrate the student patch. -->
